# TeachCS Education Repository

This is a personal repo of resources, documentation and activities that I have created as part of the PGCE Secondary Computing Course. 

Over the duration of the course I will be evidencing subject knowledge and creating lesson resources such as coding challenges and experimenting with Pycharm Courses for Education.
